## üìã **NEXT PHASE PRIORITIES**

### **üéØ HIGH IMPACT (Business Logic)**

#### **1. Staff-Service Association System** 
**Why Critical**: Staff exist but aren't connected to services
```sql
-- Need to create:
CREATE TABLE service_staff (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    service_id INT REFERENCES services(id),
    staff_id INT REFERENCES staff(id), 
    is_primary BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```
**Impact**: Users can see which staff member provides which service/language

#### **2. Admin Provider Management Enhancement**
**Current Issue**: Admin uses browser alerts instead of professional modals
**Solution**: 
- Professional provider detail modals
- Functional approve/reject with database updates  
- Trial expiry tracking and auto-freeze logic
**Impact**: Professional admin workflow

#### **3. Search & Discovery Polish**
**Current Issues**: 
- CEFR levels showing instead of language flags
- Service mode in filters should be display-only
**Solution**: Replace with flag images, clean up filter UI
**Impact**: More intuitive user experience

### **üîß MEDIUM IMPACT (Polish & Features)**

#### **4. Mobile Testing & Responsive Design**
- Test all new dashboard components on mobile
- Fix any responsive issues
- Ensure consistency with live-edit mobile experience

#### **5. Business Logic Implementation**
- Trial expiry automation (3 months)
- Account freeze/unfreeze functionality  
- Subscription status workflows
