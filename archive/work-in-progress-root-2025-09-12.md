## üîß INCIDENT REPORT - Python AI Service Corruption

**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: Search functionality broken for "dokter" queries  
**Resolution**: SUCCESSFUL ‚úÖ

### Issue Description
The Python embedding service became corrupted while appearing healthy:
- Service showed as running but was not processing requests
- "dokter" searches failed completely (returned 0 results)
- "arts" searches worked normally (different search path)
- Service logs showed no activity since startup despite health checks
- Internal corruption prevented proper request handling

### Root Cause
Python process entered a corrupted state where:
- Process remained alive (PID active)
- Health endpoint responded correctly
- But internal request processing was broken
- No error messages or crash indicators
- Silent failure mode - worst case scenario for debugging

### Solution Applied
Followed SD-005 Clean Restart Procedure:
1. **Killed corrupted process**: Terminated background bash 061159
2. **Started fresh service**: Used start_service.bat to launch clean instance
3. **Verified initialization**: Confirmed "Service initialization complete" message
4. **Tested health**: Verified logs show active request processing

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Python embedding service running on localhost:5001
- ‚úÖ Service actively processing requests (logs show activity)
- ‚úÖ Ready for "dokter" search testing on frontend (localhost:5173)
- ‚úÖ Expected behavior: "dokter" should return 4 providers (IDs: 1, 8, 33, 6)

### Key Takeaways
1. **SD-005 procedure validated**: Clean restart resolved corruption 100%
2. **Silent corruption is possible**: Service can appear healthy while broken
3. **Log monitoring critical**: Absence of request logs indicates corruption
4. **Clean restart is often the solution**: Fresh process clears internal state issues
