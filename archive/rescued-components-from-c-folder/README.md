# Rescued Components from C:\c Folder

## Overview
These files were rescued from the problematic `C:\c` directory structure that was created by mistake and causing path confusion.

## Original Location
- Original path: `C:\c\Cursor\Lingora\frontend\src\components\home\` and `C:\c\Cursor\Lingora\frontend\src\hooks\`
- Rescued on: 2025-09-01
- Reason: Cleanup of duplicate/incorrect directory structure

## Files Rescued
1. **HeroSearchBar.tsx** - Hero search bar component
2. **HeroSearchBar_FIXED.tsx** - Fixed version of hero search bar 
3. **TestHeroSearchBar.tsx** - Test version of hero search bar
4. **useLanguageRotation.tsx** - Language rotation hook

## Usage
These files are preserved for reference. Before using any of these components:
1. Check if similar components exist in the correct frontend structure (`C:\cursor\lingora\frontend\src\`)
2. Compare versions to ensure you're using the most up-to-date implementation
3. Verify compatibility with current project structure

## Correct Project Structure
- Frontend: `C:\cursor\lingora\frontend`
- Backend: `C:\xampp\htdocs\lingora\backend`
