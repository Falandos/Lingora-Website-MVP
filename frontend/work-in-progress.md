- **Backend:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\lingora` (PHP backend - no carousel components found)

### Next Actions Required:
1. **Manual Testing Required:** All carousel centering fixes need verification
2. **Cross-browser Testing:** Ensure centering works across different screen sizes
3. **Mobile Testing:** Verify mobile carousel animations and centering
4. **Performance Check:** Confirm smooth animations after changes

### Notes:
- No breaking changes introduced
- All modifications preserve existing functionality
- Changes focused on visual alignment and user experience
