### **Latest Handover - August 28, 2025 (SEARCH FILTERS CRITICAL FIX!)**
**Status**: 🎉 SEARCH FILTERS FULLY OPERATIONAL AGAIN! 🎉  
**MVP Progress**: 95% Complete - Search functionality restored
**Milestone**: MAJOR BUG FIXES - Search page filters working, homepage stable

#### 🚨 **SEARCH FILTERS EMERGENCY FIX:**
**Problem**: Search page filters broken - languages & categories not loading, F12 errors ✅ FIXED
**Root Cause**: PHP fatal errors in API endpoints caused by duplicate function declarations
**Impact**: SearchPage.tsx showing "Failed to fetch filter data" errors, no filter options

**🔧 CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED:**
1. ✅ **Fixed PHP Fatal Errors** - Removed duplicate `response()` and helper functions from individual endpoints
2. ✅ **Added Missing Statistics Route** - `/api/statistics` endpoint now properly routed
3. ✅ **Languages Filter Working** - Returns language data with flags and native names  
4. ✅ **Categories Filter Working** - Returns category hierarchy with icons
5. ✅ **Homepage Statistics Fixed** - StatisticsBar no longer shows 404 errors
6. ✅ **Cleaned Up Debugging Code** - Removed temporary debug output

**✅ CONFIRMED WORKING:**
- Search page loads without F12 errors
- Language filter dropdown populated with all supported languages  
- Category filter dropdown working with proper icons
- Homepage statistics displaying correct provider/staff/language counts
- Provider search results still working correctly

**🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
- **Issue**: Individual API endpoints (`languages/index.php`, `categories/index.php`) redeclared helper functions already defined in main router
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate function declarations and config includes from endpoint files
- **Router Fix**: Cleaned up mangled switch statement that was incorrectly routing cities → statistics
- **Frontend Port**: Now running on http://localhost:5185

**⚠️ REMAINING ISSUE - NEXT PRIORITY:**
**City Autocomplete Broken**: The city name autocomplete filter is not working
- Other filters (languages, categories) working perfectly
- City search API endpoint has routing/database connection issues
- This is the ONLY remaining search filter issue

**📍 DEVELOPMENT STATUS:**
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5185 (Vite dev server)
- **Backend**: XAMPP Apache + MySQL - all core APIs functional
- **Backend**: XAMPP Apache + MySQL running perfectly
- **Database**: 20+ providers with full language/staff/service data
