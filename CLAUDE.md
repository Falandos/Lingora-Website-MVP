# CLAUDE.md - Lingora Development System Guide
*Primary instruction file for AI-assisted development with agent system*
*Last Updated: 30-08-2025*

## ü§ñ Agent-Based Development System

### Core Principle: PM-First Workflow
**The PM agent is the central brain. It tracks EVERYTHING and controls git commits.**
**No code changes happen without PM awareness. No commits happen without PM approval.**

---

## üìã Available Agents

### 1. **project-manager (PM)** - Central Coordinator
- **Instructions**: `C:/Cursor/.claude/agents/pm-agent-instructions.md`
- **Role**: Tracks all work, maintains documentation, controls git commits
- **Usage**: "PM agent, [status/update/test results/commit]"
- **Maintains**: 
  - `/active/project-status.md` (sprint progress)
  - `/active/work-in-progress.md` (uncommitted changes)
  - `/agents/documentation-index.md` (file locations)
  - `/agents/agent-registry.md` (agent catalog)
- **Model**: Claude Opus recommended (complex coordination)

### 2. **solution-architect** - Technical Design Expert
- **Instructions**: `C:/Cursor/Lingora/agents/solution-architect-instructions.md`
- **Role**: Provides technical solution designs, clarifies implementation approaches
- **Usage**: "Solution architect, I need to implement [feature/fix]. Please clarify approach in [SD-XXX]"
- **Maintains**: solution-designs.md with detailed technical proposals
- **Always**: Provides solution ID references (SD-001, SD-002, etc.)

### 3. **git-repository-manager** - Git Operations
- **Instructions**: `C:/Cursor/.claude/agents/git-repository-manager.md`
- **Role**: Executes git operations ONLY when PM agent triggers
- **Usage**: Called by PM agent after verification
- **Never**: Called directly by user

---

## üîÑ MANDATORY Development Workflow

### Every Session MUST Follow This Flow:

START SESSION
"PM agent, what's the current status?"
‚Üí PM provides context, uncommitted work, priorities

BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION
1. "Solution architect, I need to implement [feature/fix]. Please clarify the approach in solution [SD-XXX]"
2. "PM agent, I'm about to implement [feature] following solution [SD-XXX]. This will modify [files/components]"
‚Üí PM logs planned work and creates change tracking

MAKE CHANGES
After EACH change: "PM agent, I [changed X in location Y]"
‚Üí PM logs in work-in-progress.md

TEST MANUALLY
"PM agent, test results: [pass/fail] for [component] - [details]"
‚Üí PM updates test status

REQUEST COMMIT (only if ready)
"PM agent, [feature] tested and working, ready for commit"
‚Üí PM verifies criteria ‚Üí triggers git-repository-manager

END SESSION
"PM agent, ending session, update status"
‚Üí PM saves state for next session


---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES

### ALWAYS (No Exceptions):
- ‚úÖ Start EVERY session with PM status check
- ‚úÖ Report EVERY change to PM immediately
- ‚úÖ Test manually before declaring "done"
- ‚úÖ Give PM explicit test results
- ‚úÖ Let PM decide when to commit
- ‚úÖ End session with PM status update

### NEVER (Will Break System):
- ‚ùå Make changes without telling PM
- ‚ùå Call git-repository-manager directly
- ‚ùå Say "done" without testing
- ‚ùå Commit without PM approval
- ‚ùå Create new .md files without PM tracking
- ‚ùå Skip session start/end with PM

---

## üìä PM Agent Tracking System

The PM maintains real-time project awareness through the **5-Document Active Development Structure**:
- **/active/project-status.md** - Sprint progress and milestone tracking
- **/active/work-in-progress.md** - Current session changes and test status
- **/active/bugs-and-issues.md** - Active development issues and enhancement opportunities
- **/active/technical-development.md** - Architecture decisions and implementation patterns
- **/active/session-handovers.md** - Development continuity and session context

---

## üéØ Quick Commands

```bash
# Session Start (MANDATORY)
"PM agent, provide current status and priorities"

# After Changes (MANDATORY)
"PM agent, updated [component]: [what changed]"

# After Testing (MANDATORY)
"PM agent, test results for [component]: [pass/fail] - [details]"

# Ready to Commit
"PM agent, [changes] tested and stable. Ready for commit?"

# Session End (MANDATORY)
"PM agent, ending session. Update status."

# Finding Things
"PM agent, where is [feature/doc/code]?"

# Check Uncommitted Work
"PM agent, what's pending commit?"

üö¶ Commit Control Protocol
PM agent ONLY triggers commits when ALL criteria met:

‚úÖ Changes tracked in /active/work-in-progress.md
‚úÖ Manual testing completed
‚úÖ User confirms "working"
‚úÖ No breaking changes
‚úÖ Documentation updated

Any criterion fails ‚Üí No commit, just track
