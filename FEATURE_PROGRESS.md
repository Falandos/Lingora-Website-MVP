## üöß Current Sprint Tasks (Detailed)

### Task 1: Staff-Service Association (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Staff members exist but aren't connected to specific services. Users can't see which staff member provides which service/language combination.

**Solution**: 
1. Create `service_staff` junction table
2. Add staff selection to service creation/editing
3. Display assigned staff on provider public pages
4. Show staff languages per service

**Files to Modify**:
- Database: Add `service_staff` table
- Backend: `api/services/*` endpoints  
- Frontend: `ServiceFormModal.tsx`, `ProviderPage.tsx`

### Task 2: UI Polish (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Current Issues**:
- CEFR levels showing instead of language flags in search results
- Service mode in filters should be display-only

**Solution**:
1. Replace CEFR text with flag images in `ProviderCard.tsx`
2. Remove service mode from active filters, keep as display badge
3. Update `BasicContactModal.tsx` flag display

### Task 3: Provider Profile Forms (HIGH PRIORITY)  
**Status**: Dashboard structure complete, needs form implementation
**Missing**: Profile editing, opening hours, gallery management
**Impact**: Providers can't manage their information

curl -X GET "http://localhost:5173/api/providers" -H "Authorization: Bearer [token]"

# 2. Compare responses - should both return 10 providers for admin
# 3. If different, debug /api/admin/providers endpoint routing

# 4. Check database directly
mysql -u root -e "USE lingora; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM providers;"
```
