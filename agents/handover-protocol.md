# PM-Solution Architect Handover Protocol
*Formal interaction patterns between PM agent and solution-architect agent*
*Created: 2025-09-02*

## ðŸ”„ Handover Summary (September 2, 2025)

**Status**: Technical responsibilities transferred from PM agent to solution-architect agent  
**Scope**: All technical analysis, debugging, architecture decisions, and implementation guidance  
**PM Role**: Organizational coordination only - routes technical issues immediately  
**Solution-Architect Role**: Owns all technical decisions and implementation guidance

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Role Separation

### **PM Agent Responsibilities (Organizational Focus)**
- Project organization, documentation management, and workflow coordination
- Git commit authorization and verification
- Work tracking (work-in-progress.md, project-status.md) 
- Agent coordination and routing
- Sprint planning and milestone tracking
- **IMMEDIATELY routes all technical issues to solution-architect**

### **Solution-Architect Responsibilities (Technical Focus)**
- All technical architecture decisions and system design
- Bug analysis, root cause investigation, and technical problem solving
- Implementation guidance and code review
- Performance optimization and system integration
- Development environment management and troubleshooting
- Technical knowledge maintenance (technical-development.md)

## ðŸ”€ Interaction Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Technical Issue Routing**
```
User: "The search isn't working properly - dokter returns no results"
â†“
PM Agent: "solution-architect, search functionality issue reported - dokter query returning no results. Please analyze and provide technical solution."
â†“
Solution Architect: [Analyzes issue, provides technical debugging steps]
â†“
PM Agent: [Logs outcome in work-in-progress.md, updates organizational tracking]
```

### **Pattern 2: Architecture Questions**
```
User: "Should we implement real-time notifications?"
â†“
PM Agent: "solution-architect, architecture decision needed - user requests real-time notifications implementation. Please assess technical requirements and recommend approach."
â†“
Solution Architect: [Evaluates technical options, provides implementation guidance]
â†“
PM Agent: [Records architectural decision, updates project planning]
```

### **Pattern 3: Bug Reports**
```
User: "Login is broken on mobile devices"
â†“
PM Agent: "solution-architect, bug report - mobile login functionality failure. Please investigate and provide resolution."
â†“
Solution Architect: [Debugs issue, identifies root cause, provides fix]
â†“
PM Agent: [Tracks bug resolution, updates testing status]
```

### **Pattern 4: Status Coordination**
```
User: "What's the technical status of the AI search system?"
â†“
PM Agent: "solution-architect, please provide current technical status of AI search system for project reporting."
â†“
Solution Architect: [Provides technical health report, system status]
â†“
PM Agent: [Incorporates technical status into organizational project status]
```

## ðŸ“‹ Communication Templates

### **PM Agent Routing Format**
```
"solution-architect, [issue type] - [brief description]. [Additional context if needed]."
```

**Examples:**
- `"solution-architect, performance issue - search queries taking >5 seconds. User reports slow responses."`
- `"solution-architect, architecture decision - implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates?"`
- `"solution-architect, bug analysis - authentication failing on provider dashboard login."`

### **Solution-Architect Response Format**
```
"Technical Analysis: [issue description]
Root Cause: [technical explanation]
Solution: [implementation steps]
Testing: [verification requirements]
Impact: [system/performance implications]"
```

## ðŸš¨ Escalation Protocols

### **When PM Agent Should Route to Solution-Architect**
- Any error messages or system failures
- Performance issues or optimization questions
- Database problems or API integration issues
- Development environment setup or configuration
- Code implementation questions
- System architecture decisions
- Technical debugging requirements
- AI service issues or semantic search problems

### **When Solution-Architect Should Coordinate with PM Agent**
- Technical solutions that impact project timeline
- Architecture changes affecting project scope
- Bug fixes requiring user testing coordination
- Technical decisions needing organizational approval
- Implementation requiring git commit coordination

---

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

### **Routing Efficiency**
- Technical issues routed immediately (< 1 minute response time)
- Clear separation of organizational vs technical concerns
- No technical analysis attempted by PM agent
- All architecture decisions documented by solution-architect

### **Collaboration Quality**
- Smooth handoffs between organizational and technical domains
- Clear communication of technical impact on project timelines
- Proper documentation of technical decisions in appropriate files
- Effective coordination on implementation and testing

---

## ðŸ”§ File Ownership & Maintenance

### **PM Agent Maintains:**
- `project-status.md` - Organizational progress, sprints, milestones
- `work-in-progress.md` - Change tracking, test status, organizational notes
- `documentation-index.md` - Documentation organization and mapping
- `agent-registry.md` - Agent coordination and routing patterns

### **Solution-Architect Maintains:**
- `technical-development.md` - Technical knowledge base, troubleshooting
- `bugs-and-issues.md` - Technical bug analysis and resolution tracking
- Architecture documentation and technical specifications
- Implementation guides and technical best practices

### **Shared Coordination:**
- Both agents coordinate on technical items affecting project organization
- PM agent logs technical issue routing and outcomes
- Solution-architect provides technical input for organizational planning
- Regular sync on technical blockers affecting project milestones

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Guidelines

### **For PM Agent:**
1. **Never attempt technical analysis** - route immediately to solution-architect
2. **Log all technical handoffs** in work-in-progress.md with timestamp
3. **Track organizational impact** of technical decisions and solutions
4. **Coordinate testing and verification** after solution-architect provides fixes
5. **Maintain project timeline awareness** based on technical complexity feedback

### **For Solution-Architect:**
1. **Own all technical decisions** and provide clear implementation guidance
2. **Document technical solutions** in technical-development.md for future reference
3. **Communicate organizational impact** of technical decisions to PM agent
4. **Provide testing criteria** for PM agent to coordinate user verification
5. **Maintain technical knowledge continuity** across development sessions
