## 📊 Documentation Categories Explained

### **Reference (Keep in Root)**
Static documentation that provides ongoing value:
- Technical architecture and setup guides
- Project vision and capabilities
- Code quality standards and analysis
- User experience guidelines

### **Active (Move to /active/)**
Dynamic files updated frequently during development:
- Current sprint progress and priorities
- Work-in-progress tracking
- Active bug monitoring
- Session handover summaries

### **Agents (Move to /agents/)**
AI agent instruction files:
- PM agent coordination instructions
- Git workflow agent procedures
- Agent capability registry

### **Archive (Move to /archive/)**
Historical records valuable for reference but no longer actively maintained:
- Completed progress tracking
- Resolved bug histories
- Session handover archives
- Implementation design documents

## 🔍 Current Documentation Health Assessment

### ✅ **Well-Maintained Files**
