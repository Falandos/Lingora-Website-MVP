- Provide git status and history information when requested

#### **Usage Pattern**
```
PM Agent: "git-repository-manager, commit verified changes: [detailed list]"
Git Agent: [Executes git operations, reports results]
```

#### **Critical Rules**
- ‚ùå **NEVER** called directly by user
- ‚ùå **NEVER** executes commits without PM agent authorization  
- ‚úÖ **ONLY** responds to PM agent commit triggers
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** uses proper commit message format with metadata

## üéØ Agent Coordination Workflow

### **Standard Development Flow**
```
1. User makes change ‚Üí Reports to PM Agent
2. PM Agent ‚Üí Logs in work-in-progress.md  
3. User tests ‚Üí Reports results to PM Agent
4. PM Agent ‚Üí Updates test status, verifies criteria
5. User requests commit ‚Üí PM Agent verifies ALL criteria
6. PM Agent ‚Üí Triggers git-repository-manager (if approved)
7. Git Agent ‚Üí Executes commit, reports success
8. PM Agent ‚Üí Updates tracking files, confirms completion
```

### **Technical Issue Flow** üÜï
```
User: "[Technical problem/question]"
‚Üì
PM Agent: Routes to ‚Üí "solution-architect, [technical issue]"
‚Üì
Solution Architect: Analyzes ‚Üí Provides technical solution
‚Üì
PM Agent: Logs outcome in work-in-progress.md, updates organizational status
```

### **Status Reporting Flow**
```
User: "What's the current status?"
‚Üì
PM Agent: Reads all tracking files, provides comprehensive status
(No other agents involved in status reporting)
```

### **Emergency Procedures**
```
PM Agent Not Responding:
1. Reload from pm-agent-instructions.md
2. Verify work-in-progress.md accessibility
3. Manual status check if needed

Urgent Commit Needed:  
1. Still route through PM Agent
2. Use "URGENT:" prefix for expedited review
3. PM Agent can fast-track if criteria clearly met
```

## üìã Agent Interaction Patterns

### **User ‚Üí PM Agent** (Primary Interface)
- Status requests and updates
- Change reporting and tracking  
- Test result communication
- Commit authorization requests
- Priority and planning discussions
- **Routes technical issues to solution-architect**

### **PM Agent ‚Üí Solution Architect** (Technical Coordination) üÜï
- Technical issue routing and escalation
- Architecture decision coordination
- Bug report forwarding and tracking
- Technical implementation guidance requests
- System health monitoring coordination

### **PM Agent ‚Üí Git Agent** (Internal Coordination)
- Commit execution after verification
- Repository status queries
- Git workflow coordination
- Authentication issue resolution

### **PM Agent ‚Üí User** (Status & Control)

- Change acknowledgment and tracking
- Commit approval or rejection  
- Priority recommendations
- Session continuity maintenance

---

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **DO NOT**
- ‚ùå Call git-repository-manager directly (bypasses verification)
- ‚ùå Make changes without reporting to PM Agent
- ‚ùå Request commits without manual testing
- ‚ùå Skip PM Agent for status updates
- ‚ùå Create new .md files without PM tracking
- ‚ùå Route technical issues incorrectly (always go through PM ‚Üí solution-architect)

### **ALWAYS**
- ‚úÖ Start session with PM Agent status check
- ‚úÖ Report every change to PM Agent immediately  
- ‚úÖ Provide explicit test results to PM Agent
- ‚úÖ Let PM Agent control commit timing
- ‚úÖ End session with PM Agent status update
- ‚úÖ Route technical issues: User ‚Üí PM Agent ‚Üí solution-architect
