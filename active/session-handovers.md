## 📋 Latest Session Summary

### **Session Goal**: ALPHA 0.1 Refinement Phase - Critical Issue Resolution  
**Date**: August 30, 2025  
**Focus**: Fix critical search issues blocking core platform functionality  
**Status**: 🚨 **URGENT** - 5 critical issues require immediate attention  
**Philosophy**: Refinement over new features - make everything work EXACTLY as intended

### **What Was Discovered**

**🚨 Critical Issues Identified:**
- Search returns no results for "dokter" - blocking medical provider discovery
- AI semantic search service not running on port 5001
- Location fallback missing when no city provided  
- City filter incomplete - missing Dutch cities like Zaandam
- MySQL stability concerns after recent crashes

**📝 Tracking System Updated:**
1. **project-status.md** - Sprint changed to ALPHA 0.1 Refinement Phase
2. **bugs-and-issues.md** - All 5 critical issues logged with detailed analysis
3. **work-in-progress.md** - Phase 1 critical fixes work plan established
4. **session-handovers.md** (this document) - Updated with refinement focus

**🎯 Phase 1 Work Plan Established:**
- Fix 1.1: Start AI semantic search service (port 5001) - IMMEDIATE
- Fix 1.2: Add default location fallback - HIGH PRIORITY
- Fix 1.3: Debug SQL keyword search for "dokter" - HIGH PRIORITY
- Fix 1.4: Add comprehensive Dutch city list - PLANNED

### **Key Decisions Made**

**Refinement Phase Strategy:**
- Fix critical issues before any new feature work
- Focus 100% on making search work EXACTLY as intended
- Defer all UI/UX improvements until core functionality restored
- No language expansion until existing search works perfectly

**Critical Priority Order:**
1. AI semantic search service startup (blocking all semantic search)
2. Location fallback implementation (user experience blocker)
3. "dokter" keyword search debugging (medical provider discovery blocked)
4. Dutch city list expansion (geographic coverage gaps)
5. MySQL stability investigation (system reliability)

## 🎯 Current Priorities & Next Session Focus

### **CRITICAL: Phase 1 Fixes (STARTING IMMEDIATELY)**

**1. AI Semantic Search Service (CRITICAL - Fix 1.1)**
- **Issue**: Service not running on port 5001
- **Impact**: No AI-powered semantic search functionality
- **Action**: Investigate service startup, check configuration, ensure running
- **Test**: Verify `curl http://localhost:5001/health` returns 200

**2. Location Fallback Logic (HIGH PRIORITY - Fix 1.2)**
- **Issue**: No results when user doesn't specify city
- **Impact**: Users must know to specify location for any results
- **Action**: Implement nationwide fallback or default to major city
- **Test**: Search without city selection should return results

**3. "dokter" Search Debug (HIGH PRIORITY - Fix 1.3)**
- **Issue**: Medical term searches return no results
- **Impact**: Medical provider discovery completely blocked
- **Action**: Debug SQL keyword search, check term matching
- **Test**: "dokter" search must return medical providers

**4. Dutch City List Expansion (PLANNED - Fix 1.4)**
- **Issue**: Missing cities like Zaandam in filter options
- **Impact**: Users in certain cities cannot filter properly
- **Action**: Research comprehensive Dutch city database
- **Test**: Major Dutch cities should be selectable in filters

### **Deferred Until Core Functionality Fixed**
*(NO work on these until search is working perfectly)*

- Language expansion (Turkish, German, Arabic, Polish, Chinese)
- Mobile responsive testing and optimization
- UI consistency and accessibility enhancements
- Staff-service association system
- Enhanced admin management tools
- Performance optimization and bundle analysis
- Image upload interface for provider galleries

**Refinement Philosophy**: Perfect what we have before adding anything new
