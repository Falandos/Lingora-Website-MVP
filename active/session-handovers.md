## 🎯 Current Priorities & Next Session Focus

### **CRITICAL: Phase 1 Fixes (STARTING IMMEDIATELY)**

**1. AI Semantic Search Service (CRITICAL - Fix 1.1)**
- **Issue**: Service not running on port 5001
- **Impact**: No AI-powered semantic search functionality
- **Action**: Investigate service startup, check configuration, ensure running
- **Test**: Verify `curl http://localhost:5001/health` returns 200

**2. Location Fallback Logic (HIGH PRIORITY - Fix 1.2)**
- **Issue**: No results when user doesn't specify city
- **Impact**: Users must know to specify location for any results
- **Action**: Implement nationwide fallback or default to major city
- **Test**: Search without city selection should return results

**3. "dokter" Search Debug (HIGH PRIORITY - Fix 1.3)**
- **Issue**: Medical term searches return no results
- **Impact**: Medical provider discovery completely blocked
- **Action**: Debug SQL keyword search, check term matching
- **Test**: "dokter" search must return medical providers

**4. Dutch City List Expansion (PLANNED - Fix 1.4)**
- **Issue**: Missing cities like Zaandam in filter options
- **Impact**: Users in certain cities cannot filter properly
- **Action**: Research comprehensive Dutch city database
- **Test**: Major Dutch cities should be selectable in filters

### **Deferred Until Core Functionality Fixed**
*(NO work on these until search is working perfectly)*

- Language expansion (Turkish, German, Arabic, Polish, Chinese)
- Mobile responsive testing and optimization
- UI consistency and accessibility enhancements
- Staff-service association system
- Enhanced admin management tools
- Performance optimization and bundle analysis
- Image upload interface for provider galleries

**Refinement Philosophy**: Perfect what we have before adding anything new
