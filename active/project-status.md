### 🎉 Recent Major Accomplishments

#### ✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: UI LANGUAGE SWITCH LOGIC FIX (Sep 2 - SESSION 6)**

##### ✅ **Smart Language Detection Implementation**
- **Problem Solved**: Fixed issue where typing "turkish" in English UI incorrectly triggered Turkish UI switch popup
- **Root Cause Resolution**: System was confusing language filter searches with typing IN that language
- **Intelligent Logic**: Now distinguishes between language filter searches vs foreign word usage
- **Enhanced Backend**: Updated `LanguageDetector.php` with `containsLanguageNames()` method and UI language context
- **Frontend Integration**: Added `ui_lang` parameter to search API requests for proper language detection
- **Smart Suggestions**: Language filters ("turkish lawyer") → No popup; Foreign words ("dokter", "avocat") → UI switch suggested

##### 📊 **Comprehensive Testing Results**
- ✅ "turkish" in English UI: No popup (correct - searching FOR Turkish services)
- ✅ "dokter" in English UI: Dutch UI switch suggested (correct - typing IN Dutch)
- ✅ "avocat" in English UI: French UI switch suggested (correct - typing IN French)
- ✅ Context-aware suggestions that understand user intent
- ✅ Zero false positives for language filter searches
- ✅ Enhanced UX with intelligent, non-disruptive suggestions
